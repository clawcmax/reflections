What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary stage where you can reflect on what you did

	permanent. If you happen to make a mistake, the staging area shows you what
	you are doing and you can fix it before you commit.
